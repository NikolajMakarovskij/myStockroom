# ***Get Starting***

## Requirements before installation

### Additional Software

1. To deploy the program, you will need pre-installed:
    * Docker Ğ¸ Docker compose

    or

    * Docker desktop

2. The installation of Docker can be found at [link](
https://docs.docker.com/engine/).

3. The installation of Docker compose can be found at [link](
https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

4. The installation of Docker desktop can be found at [link](
https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Setting up Environment variables

1. In the folder ***backend/database/Init_db/*** there is a test database to demonstrate the operation of the program. If you do not need a test database, delete the ***init.sql*** file from the folder;
2. In the ***backend/*** folder, open the ***.env*** file. The values of the variables are shown in the table below:

2. Enter the command:

    ```
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3. Wait for the containers to be assembled and launched;
4. After starting the containers, open a new console window;
5. To create a superuser, enter:

    ```
    docker exec -it container_name python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

6. Go to [0.0.0.0/](http://0.0.0.0/) or [localhost/home/](http://localhost/);
7. Log in with the data specified in clause 5.

`If the program was deployed from a test database, the user will be available: login: admin password: admin.`
